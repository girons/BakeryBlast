// The reason you can make Swap into a struct is that this object does not have an
// "identity". A Swap that links to cookieX and cookieY is identical to another Swap
// instance that links to cookieX and cookieY, even those these two instances each
// take up their own space in memory. So these two Swap instances are interchangeable,
// which is why they dont'have an identity.
